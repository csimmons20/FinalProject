# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

The title for my project will likely be "Security!!"

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

Create a device that sends a picture of someone if said person triggered something.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

   This idea was inspired by my Dad's when he worked at a company where he would install security cameras into people's home.
This is also inspired by those spy movies where the main character had to avoid setting off the alarms of a building by not
triggering a lazer. So I thought, why not combine both ideas? So for my final product, I wanted to create device that sends a
picture when a lazer is triggered by someone/something to a place to store those pictures (most likely a webpage I design).
I will try to do this by using the software Python and Rasberry Pi (w/ a camera module port) and Raspberry Pi Camera Module.
This project will be following the steup of other rasberry pi projects 

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

I will accomplish setting up the rasberry pi.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I think I can accomplish setting up the storage and rasberry pi and program it write.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I hope to accomplish sending the pictures taken by the raspberry pi and put them on the webpage.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

First, I need to get the supplies needed for this project that is listed below:
	a. Python
	b. Rasberry Pi (w/ camera module port)
	c. Raspberry Pi Camera Module
	d. Breadboard
	e. 1ÂµF Capacitor
	f. Light-Dependent Resistor (LDR)
	g. Female-male Jumper Leads
	h. Female-Female Jumper Leads
	i. Lazer Pointer
   While I'm waiting for the products to come in, I will need to learn a bit more on Rasberry Pi. I will need to learn about
using the breadboard. Once the supplies are in, I would start setting up the circuit and the Rasberry Pi along with making an
outline for my program.
