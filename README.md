# PythonFinalProject
For my final project, I programmed a raspberry pi in which when a laser was triggered, it would send a picture of the person/thing that triggered it. The description of the project is down below.

# Title
"Security!!"

# Abstract
This project is to help coders to learn coding a program on a device called raspberry pi. It also helps to use Python and learn of the imports such as PiCamera, Light Sensor, and email.


# Materials Needed
Software:
    - Python
    - Raspberry Pi Imager

Computer Hardware:
    - Raspberry Pi 4
        - SD Card
        - Raspberry Pi 15.3W USB-C Power Supply
        - Micro HDMI to Standard HDMI (A/M) Cable
        - USB Cable Mouse
        - USB  Cable Keyboard
    - Raspberry Pi NoIR Camera Board v2 - 8 Megapixels
    - REXQualis Upgraded Complete Starter Kit for Raspberry Pi 4
	    - Breadboard
	    - 1ÂµF Capacitor
	    - Light-Dependent Resistor (LDR)
	    - Female-male Jumper Leads
	    - Female-Female Jumper Leads
	- Lazer Pointer

# Procedure
    1. Gather all your materials. 
    2. Set up your raspberry pi. Follow the intructions from the link from 'Set Up Raspberry Pi' in the bibliography.
        a. Afterword, if Python IDLE is not part of the OS, then install it with this line of code in the raspberry terminal:
            sudo apt update
            sudo apt install python3 idle3
    3. Set up the camera module. Reference from the link from 'Camera Module' in the bibliography.
    4. Create a prototype on the breadboard that detects a broken beam. Reference from the link from 'Raspberry Pi Laser Tripwire' in the bibliography.
    5. After, in Python, start coding your light sensor, pi camera, and email. Reference 'Email Using Python', 'Raspberry Pi Laser Tripwire', and 'Camera Module' to help. Test the program
    6. Once done, build the laser tripwire. Reference 'Raspberry Pi Laser Tripwire' to help.
